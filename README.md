# Project_Duo_Mage

###
Hello, and welcome to the Github repository for Project: Duo Mage (name pending). 
If you have not already, please make sure you read the ReadMe card within the Trello board for this project.
Please also read the GDD in the Google Drive.

General Rules: 
  1. **NEVER** Edit the Main branch. All tasks should begin with crqeating a new branch, and only merging the 
      branch into Main once completed and approved.
  2. Approvals will be sent to Tim Lorgeree at tlorgeree@gmail.com. Please reach out with any questions.
  3. Please update Trello cards accordingly after beginning/finishing tasks.
  4. PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE USE CODE DOCUMENTATION. If your code can't be read by others and be understood
      via annotations and sensible variable names, it hurts the team in the future.
  5. For consistency, please notate Sankecase (variables with underscores as seperators), "obj_Ball" or "spr_Player_Attack_Base"
      Please avoid using Camelcase or Pascalcase. Capitalization within Snakecase is totally fine.
  6. Please visit: https://curc.readthedocs.io/en/latest/programming/coding-best-practices.html
    for more info on proper code documentation.
